## LC 38. Count and Say

https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/count-and-say/

The count-and-say sequence is a sequence of digit strings defined by the recursive formula:

countAndSay(1) = "1"
countAndSay(n) is the way you would "say" the digit string from countAndSay(n-1), which is then converted into a different digit string.
To determine how you "say" a digit string, split it into the minimal number of groups so that each group is a contiguous section all of the same character. Then for each group, say the number of characters, then say the character. To convert the saying into a digit string, replace the counts with a number and concatenate every saying.

Input: n = 4
Output: "1211"
Explanation:
countAndSay(1) = "1"
countAndSay(2) = say "1" = one 1 = "11"
countAndSay(3) = say "11" = two 1's = "21"
countAndSay(4) = say "21" = one 2 + one 1 = "12" + "11" = "1211"

### 思路

Naive approach  
感觉并不优雅 Q_Q

### 代码 JavaScript

```JavaScript
var countAndSay = function(n) {

  let k = 1;
  let ans = '1'

  while(k < n){

    let cur = ans[0]
    let temp = ''
    let count = 0
    for(let i = 0; i < ans.length; i++){
      if(ans[i] == cur){
        count++
      }else{
        temp += `${count}`+cur
        cur = ans[i]
        count = 1;
      }
      if(i == ans.length - 1) temp += count.toString() + cur
    }


    ans = temp
    k++
  }

return ans
};

```
